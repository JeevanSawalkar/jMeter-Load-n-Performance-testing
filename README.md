# jMeter- Load and Performance Testing

> _JMeter is an open-source tool for load and performance testing, simulating multiple users to analyze system behavior under stress. It helps identify bottlenecks, measure response times, and ensure application scalability._
## GUI MODE - jMeter App
In my project on JMeter for load and performance testing, I worked in **GUI mode**, creating a **test plan** with a **thread group** to simulate multiple users. I configured **HTTP requests** using IP-based testing, set user load parameters (**threads, loop count**), and saved the test as a **.jmx file**. Additionally, I utilized **listeners**, including **View Results Tree**, to collect and analyze performance metrics.
